MetaMars: 3DoF+ Roaming With Panoramic Stitching for Tianwen-1 Mission

This is a demonstration of the Mars roaming system presented in the paper "MetaMars: 3DoF+ Roaming With Panoramic Stitching for Tianwen-1 Mission". The model uses images captured by the Zhurong rover's Navigation and Terrain Camera (NaTeCam)  and the High resolution imaging camera (HiRIC) of the orbiter satellite during the Tianwen-1 Mars exploration mission. We used the stitching-combines-features-and-projection (SCFP) algorithm to stitch the images together into a panoramic view, and the DIM model for localization.


All datasets are processed and produced by the Ground Research and Application System (GRAS) of Chinaâ€™s Lunar and Planetary Exploration Program, provided by China National Space Administration (http://moon.bao.ac.cn).

Please refer to the paper "MetaMars: 3DoF+ Roaming With Panoramic Stitching for Tianwen-1 Mission" for more details on the methodology and results of this project.
